# People Service Technical Documentation

## Notes

- Currently, there's a single hard-coded API key. A possible enhancement
can be for a generated API key to be sent to the email address to
prove ownership.
- some other stuff

## API

### Introduction

The People Service currently offers an **HTTP REST API**.
In this document, you will find all API operations currently supported
in the platform and examples on how to execute them.

### Authentication

In order to be able to make requests to the API, you should first obtain an API key.
